# Landslide_shape_tools
Contains code for measuring landslide ellipticity and length-to-width ratio in triggered landslide event inventories. For more information, see https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/esp.4479. There are two codes:

(A) A Python code that will run in ArcGIS to fit ellispes to landslide polygons 
(B) An R code for fitting an inverse gamma distribution to the values of length to width ratio for each landslide ellipse

In the long term, I plan to release a python code that will run in QGIS. However, due to the upgrade to QGIS3, this is taking some time and is a bit buggy. Feel free to get in touch for more info or if you'd like to help translate the code!
